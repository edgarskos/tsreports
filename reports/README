	This is a sample report file.  It shows how to write reports.
	The report language is fairly simple.  Normal text, like this,
	is ignored, and can be used to describe the report.  The actual
	definition of the query is done in sections, which are indicated
	by starting the line with a '%'.

	In this example, all commentary is indented for readability. 
	However, this is not a requirement.

	First, set the name and description of the report.  These are shown to 
	the user in the web interface.  This shows how to write a simple,
	one-line definition.

%name Last 100 edits
%description Shows the last 100 edits for a user

	You can also specify the description in other languages.

%name:de This would be displayed to a German user.
%description:de
This is the German description.  As you can see, descriptions may span
multiple lines.
%end

	Category is used to sort the list of reports in the web interface.
	There's no fixed list of available categories, you can write
	anything you want here.  If a report doesn't have a category, it's
	put into 'miscellaneous'.

	Note that before you use a category, you *must* define an i18n 
	messages for it in at least i18n/en.msgs.

%category users

	If this is a slow query, it should be cached instead of run every time. 
	There are two ways to do this: either mark it as a %nightly query, or
	specify '%cache <time>'.  The former will run the query once every night
	and cache the results until the next run.  The latter will cache the
	query for the specified amount of time; the next request after this time
	was expired will regenerate the cache.

	Note that queries with variables cannot be cached.

	One hour:
	%cache 3600

	Or:
	%nightly

	Next, we set the query used to generate this report.  This can be either a
	simple query, or a query with variables.  Variables can be used like this:

	%(VARNAME)s 

	This shows how to write a multi-line value, which is useful for long values
	like %query.  The '%query' on its own starts the value, and '%end' marks the
	end.  Everything in-between is the value.

	Also notice the %(username)s in the query.  This is a user-supplied variable,
	which are explained below.

%query
# Inside a section, you can use a '#' at the start of a line to write
# embedded comments.
SELECT page_namespace, page_title, rev_timestamp 
	FROM page,revision 
	WHERE rev_user_text=%(username)s 
		AND rev_page=page_id 
	ORDER BY rev_timestamp DESC 
	LIMIT 100
%end

	If you used variables above, you have to define them here.  The syntax is:

	  %variable <name>, <type>, <params>
	 
	'params' specifies some type-specific values.  Currently only one type is
	defined, username:
	 
	  username, <field name>

	If you used %(foo)s above, you should defined "var_foo" here.

	The user will be prompted to enter values for these variables when he runs a
	query.  Note that queries that depend on variables cannot be cached.

%variable username, username, Username

	Next you specify the output fields for your query.  It's a list of field
	definitions, one per line. A field definition is: 

		<type>, <display title>, <fields>

	Each field is separated by a comma and any number of spaces or tabs.

	<fields> varies by types; the following types are currently available:

	   page, <display title>, <namespace field>, <title field>
	       <namespace field> - set it to the SQL field containing the page namespace
	       <title field> - set it to the SQL field containing the page title

	   user, <display title>, <username field>
	       <username field> - set it to the SQL field containing the username

	   timestamp, <display title>, <timestamp field>
	       <username field> - set it to the SQL field containing the timestamp in MediaWiki format

	   number, <display title>, <number field>
	       <username field> - set it to the SQL field containing the number

	   text, <display title>, <text field>
	       <text field> - set it to the SQL field containing the text; no formatting
			      will be done.

	Here we define two fields - 'Page', a page title created from (page_namespace,page_title)
	and 'Time', a timestamp.  We use tabs to separate the fields, to improve legibility.

%fields
page,		 Page,	 page_namespace, page_title 
timestamp,	 Time,	 rev_timestamp
%end
